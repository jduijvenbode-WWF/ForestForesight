}
\arguments{
\item{ff_folder}{Character. Local folder to sync data to.}

\item{identifier}{Character or SpatVector.
When a character it should be either a tile ID (e.g., "00N_000E") or a country ISO3 code.}

\item{features}{Vector or Character. Either a vector of feature names or one of "Highest", "High",
"Medium", "Low", "Everything" (default), or "Small Model" (case-insensitive).}

\item{date_start}{Character. Start date in format "YYYY-MM-DD". Must be first of month and not before 2021-01-01.}

\item{date_end}{Character. End date in format "YYYY-MM-DD". Must be first of month and not after current month.}

\item{download_model}{Logical. Whether to download the corresponding model.
Only works when downloading for entire countries. Default is FALSE.}

\item{download_data}{Logical. Whether to download the preprocessed input data. Default is TRUE.}

\item{download_predictions}{Logical. Whether to download the prediction data.
Only works when downloading for entire countries. Default is FALSE.}

\item{download_groundtruth}{Logical. Whether to download the groundtruth data as well.
This should be turned off when you want to use your own data as groundtruth. Default is TRUE.}

\item{groundtruth_pattern}{The pattern to search for.
This is normally groundtruth6m for 6 months but can be set to groundtruth1m, groundtruth3m
or groundtruth12m for one, three or twelve months respectively}

\item{bucket}{Character. Name of the S3 bucket. Default is "forestforesight-public".}

\item{region}{Character. AWS region of the bucket. Default is "eu-west-1".}

\item{verbose}{Logical. Whether the function should be verbose.}
}
\value{
Invisible NULL. The function is called for its side effects.
}
\description{
This function synchronizes ForestForesight data from a public S3 bucket to a local folder.
It can sync data for a specific tile or an entire country, including input data, ground truth data,
and optionally model data.
